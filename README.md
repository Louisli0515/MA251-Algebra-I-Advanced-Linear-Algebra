# MA251-Algebra-I-Advanced-Linear-Algebra-Revision
My own notes about MA251, including example sheets and past papars

This repository will mainly focus on two parts, support class questions and past papers. I will provide the pdf made by myself so there will not be any problems about license.

## Lecture notes


First thing first, lecture notes. Feel free to download the 2022 version from University of Warwick.
